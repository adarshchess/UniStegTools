hehehe haas dene rikiya ke papa,

vartamaan aakhon ka dhoka hai,

bhoot seekhne ka mauka hai

bhavishya umeed ki nauka hai 

aaj mera sangeet se roka hai

I woke up today with motivation, confidence, and discipline.
Unfortunately, all three of them left the group chat the moment I opened my laptop.
My brain said “let’s grind”, my body said “five more minutes”, and my soul said “what the fuck is the point anyway”.
Somewhere between opening LeetCode and staring at the wall, I achieved enlightenment:
procrastination isn’t laziness, it’s aggressive optimism that tomorrow’s version of me will handle this shit better.

Now comes the space torture test.
Between the two words below is an ungodly, obscene, criminal number of spaces.

START END
